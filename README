Ocean
=====

Ocean is a trivial language that compiles directly to C source code.

For my continuing studies at UNH, I am taking CS 520, which involves writing C code,
but I have a mild dislike for brackets and a heavy distrust of semicola as line-
delimiters. Therefore, I wrote Ocean, which is like C but looks different.

Every Ocean program translates directly to a C program. For example,

----
int main ‚Üê void:
    printf $ "Hello, World!\n"
    return 0
----

becomes

----
int main(void):
{
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
----

More features will be forthcoming once C annoys me sufficiently to add
additional compiler passes.

Both the Ocean compiler (`preproc.py') and `ocean-mode.el', a mode for
editing Ocean files in Emacs are provided under the GPL, version 2,
or any later version at your discretion.
